Satchless - less is mo'
=======================

A shop for perfectionists with deadlines and coding standards.

Overview
========

Satchless is a high level framework that provides building blocks for an online
shop. It's based on `Django`_ web application framework and written in
`Python`_ language. The aim of this project is to make each module
independent and extensible. Using Satchless you will be able to quickly build:

    * A product catalog
    * A catalog with wishlists
    * An online shop with:
        * shippable products,
        * downloadable products
        * with both of them or any other product type you may imagine.

.. _`Django`: http://djangoproject.org/
.. _`Python`: http://python.org/

.. note::
   Satchless is not a turn-key solution for online shops and is not meant to be
   one. It should be considered as a set of advanced, loosely coupled bricks
   which can be turned into a working shop by a web developer.

**Warning:** Currently Satchless is in an early stage of development. It is
already possible to build a shop on top of it, but still you should be prepared
for radical and backward-incompatible changes to the code.
