Satchless - less is mo'
=======================

A shop for perfectionists with deadlines and coding standards.

Overview
========

Satchless is a high level framework which provides parts to build an online
shop. It's based on `Django`_ web application framework and written in
`Python`_ language. The aim of this project is to make each module
independent and extensible. Using Satchless you will be able to build quickly:

    * A product catalog
    * A catalog with wishlists
    * An online shop with:
        * shippable products,
        * downloadable products
        * with both of them or any other product type you may imagine.

.. _`Django`: http://djangoproject.org/
.. _`Python`: http://python.org/
