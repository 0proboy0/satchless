Pricing and taxing overview
===========================

Satchles comes with support for pluggable price handlers. A handler can do
anything with a price before it's shown to customer or put into an order,
for example:

    * extract the price from database (or any other data source),
    * calculate discounts for multiple-item purchase,
    * add tax,
    * calculate special discounts: temporary sales, promotions, discounts
      for regular customers, etc.

Handlers can be chained together, to process the prices in defined order.
The setting ``SATCHLESS_PRICING_HANDLERS`` is a list of modules or other
objects which extract or modify the price.

Each of the handlers accepts price(s) from the previous one and returns
same set of data to be processed in the next step. Of course, you should
configure it wisely and ensure that first handler does not require input
data, but fetches it from database or any storage of your preference.

Standard handlers in satchless
------------------------------

Here's an example of standard configuration, using modules provided by
satchless::

    SATCHLESS_PRICING_HANDLERS = [
        'satchless.contrib.pricing.simpleqty.handler',
        'satchless.contrib.tax.flatgroups.handler',
    ]

The first step is ``satchless.contrib.pricing.simpleqty`` module, responsible
for storing and retrieving prices for products and variants. It has limited
set of basic features:

    * Each product can have a base price.
    * Each variant can have a price modifier (called *offset*) to the base
      product price.
    * Each product can have special prices for larger quantities. They can
      work in two modes: *per variant* when the minimal quantity of single
      variant is present in the cart, or *per product* when the quantity
      of all product's variants in the cart reaches the limit.
    * It doesn't care about currency.

The second step is taxing module in ``satchless.contrib.tax.flatgroups``, which
defines groups of products with different tax rates. It can also have a default
"catch-all" group.  The price given by former handler is being processed here
and used on the shop pages.

Price objects
-------------

Satchless uses special ``satchless.pricing.Price`` objects internally. Each
of them represents a double price set: ``net`` and ``gross``. In a shop where
taxing is not being handled, they are equal.

These objects can handle a limited set of operations. For example, you may add
two ``Price`` objects together, but multiplication may use only single-number
objects as the second argument (e.g. ``int``, ``Decimal`` and also ``float``
which is not recommended due to limited precision, unacceptable in monetary
operations).

The ``Price`` object may carry additional data. One of them is *currency*
3-letter code, stored in the ``currency`` attribute. **Price objects with
different currencies cannot be added or subtracted.**

The other data is *tax name*, which holds a short description of the tax rate
applied. In most cases, you have to take care of this data being transferred to
new ``Price`` objects you create.

Using handlers
--------------

To get prices processed by entire handlers stack, use the interface provided
by ``satchless.pricing.handler``. The following functions will return a single
``Price`` object:

    * ``get_variant_price(variant, currency, quantity=1, **context)``
    * ``get_cartitem_unit_price(cartitem, currency, **context)``

They should be used to get a price of variant and cart item respectively,
in the currency specified.

Important thing here is the ``context`` which allows you to put many
additional parameters for handlers to inspect. For example, you may add
cart or customer object there for discounts based on cart contents or
customer history, nationality, birthday, etc.

The following function returns a tuple, which is a range of prices for
the cheapest and the most expensive variants available:

    * ``get_product_price_range(product, currency, **context)``

The default handler
-------------------

The default handler shipped with satchless
(``satchless.contrib.pricing.simpleqty.handler``) offers quantity-based
discount in two forms:
    * *per variant*: variant quantity changes the price. For example,
      you will get a discount for buying *â‰¥n* yellow t-shirts, but adding
      green ones will not change the price.
    * *per product*: quantity of all product's variants counts into a
      discount. You may get a lower price, depending on the total number
      of t-shirts ordered, no matter what colour they have.

In the currency terms, this handler is a stupid one.  It will
automatically sign the price retrieved from database with any currency
code you ask it.

However, more advanced handlers for multi-currency shops should return a
``Price`` object **only** if a value is found for the currency they have been
asked for. Otherwise, they should return ``None``.
